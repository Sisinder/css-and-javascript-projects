            <p>I am excited to submit my application for the Full Stack Developer position with DevOps exposure at your company. With 3+ years of experience in software development, I have honed my skills in full-stack development and have also gained exposure
                to DevOps practices. In my previous roles, I have demonstrated proficiency in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python, and have experience in defining and implementing REST APIs for web and mobile applications. My familiarity with modern web
                app development practices and NoSQL databases has allowed me to deliver efficient and scalable solutions for both backend and frontend requirements. As a self-starter with strong communication skills, I have been able to work well both
                independently and in team environments. I have a methodical approach to problem-solving, and my pragmatic perfectionist mindset has allowed me to deliver high-quality work while meeting project timelines. In addition to my software development
                skills, I have also gained exposure to DevOps practices through my experience with deployment of web services in a cloud environment using Microsoft Azure. I have experience with Docker and Kubernetes, and am familiar with continuous integration
                platforms such as Azure DevOps and Jenkins. I am excited to bring my skills and experience to your team and contribute to your company's success. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss
                how I can support your organization.
